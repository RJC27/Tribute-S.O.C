      <h3 class="headings">Who Was Ayrton Senna?</h3>
      <p class="para1">
        Ayrton Senna da Silva was a Brazilian racing driver who won the Formula
        One World Drivers' Championship in 1988, 1990, and 1991. Senna is one of
        three Formula One drivers from Brazil to win the World Championship and
        won 41 Grands Prix and 65 pole positions, with the latter being the
        record until 2006.
      </p>
      <p class="para1">
        Senna began his motorsport career in karting, moved up to open-wheel
        racing in 1981 and won the 1983 British Formula Three Championship. He
        made his Formula One debut with Toleman-Hart in 1984, before moving to
        Lotus-Renault the following year and winning six Grands Prix over the
        next three seasons. In 1988, he joined Frenchman Alain Prost at
        McLaren-Honda. Between them, they won all but one of the 16 Grands Prix
        that year, and Senna claimed his first World Championship.

      <h3 class="headings">The Run Up To Senna's Death...</h3>
      <p class="para1">
        The 1994 San Marino Grand Prix was held on the Autodromo Enzo e Dino
        Ferrari circuit located in Imola, Italy, between 28 April, and 1 May
        1994. The European leg of the F1 season, starting at Imola, was
        traditionally considered the beginning of the yearly competition. Senna,
        who did not finish the two opening races of the season, declared that
        this was where his season would start, with 14 races, as opposed to 16,
        in which to win the title.
      </p>
      <p class="para1">
        At the start of the Grand Prix, Senna retained the lead from his chief
        rival Michael Schumacher, but proceedings were soon interrupted by a
        startline accident. JJ Lehto's Benetton-Ford stalled and was hit by the
        Lotus-Mugen Honda of Pedro Lamy. As Senna rounded the high-speed
        Tamburello corner on lap 7, his car left the racing line at around 307
        km/h (191 mph), ran in a straight line off the track, and hit the
        concrete retaining wall at around 233 km/h (145 mph), after what
        telemetry showed to be an application of the brakes for around two
        seconds. The red flag was shown as a consequence of the accident. Within
        two minutes of crashing, Senna was extracted from his race car by
        Watkins and his medical team, including intensive care anaesthetist
        Giovanni Gordini. The initial treatment took place by the side of the
        car, with Senna having a weak heartbeat and significant blood loss from
        his temporal artery being ruptured. At this point, Senna had already
        lost around 4.5 litres of blood, constituting 90% of his blood volume.
        Because of Senna's grave neurological condition, Watkins performed an
        on-site tracheotomy and requested the immediate airlifting of Senna to
        Bologna's Maggiore Hospital under the supervision of Gordini.
      </p>
      <p class="para1">
        At 18:40 (16:40 GMT), the head of the hospital's emergency department,
        Maria Teresa Fiandri made the announcement that Senna had died.
      </p>

          <h3 class="headings">Mythical Senna shortly After</h3>
          <p class="para2">
            It was later revealed that when the medical staff examined Senna's
            vehicle, a furled Austrian flag was discovered—he had intended to
            raise it in honour of Ratzenberger (A fellow driver that died the
            day before in qualifying) after the race.
          </p>
          <p class="para2">
            Senna's death was considered by many of his Brazilian fans to be a
            national tragedy, and the Government of Brazil declared three days
            of national mourning. The Italian Air Force offered to fly the
            coffin back to Brazil, but the Senna family wished that it return
            home in a Brazilian plane. Contrary to airline policy and out of
            respect, Senna's coffin was allowed to be flown back to his home
            country in the passenger cabin of a VARIG McDonnell-Douglas MD-11
            airliner, accompanied by his distraught younger brother, Leonardo,
            and close friends. The plane was escorted by fighter jets into São
            Paulo-Guarulhos International Airport on 4 May 1994, where it was
            met by the Mayor of São Paulo, Paulo Maluf, and the state's
            governor, Luiz Antônio Fleury. The coffin was carried by soldiers
            from the Air Force Police to a fire engine, where eight cadets from
            the Military Police Academy mounted guard as it carried the coffin
            on the 20-mile (32.2 km) journey into the city. Leading the
            motorcade were 17 police motorbikes, and 2,500 policemen lined the
            route to keep the crowds at bay.
